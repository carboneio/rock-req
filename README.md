## üî• Why?

In most existing libraries (2023):

- Managing **reliable retries** is difficult, tricky with streams and not battle-tested
- Using **multiple forward proxies** has several benefits like **higher availability** and **increased bandwidth** but 
  **Intercepting retries** to use another Egress controller between two requests is not possible.
- Many request libraries are heavy: node-fetch, superagent, needle, got, axios, request
- Lightweight alternatives are not as light as they claim due to dependencies (simple-get, tiny-req, puny-req, phin, ...)

‚ö°Ô∏è **Rock-req** solves these problems with only **150 lines of code** and **zero dependencies**

It also supports many features:

- Follows redirects
- Handles **gzip/deflate/brotli** responses
- Modify defaults
- Extend and create new instances
- Automatically destroy input/output **stream** on error and premature close event
- **Advanced retries**
- URL Rewrite
- **Ultra-fast (> 20k req/s)**
- Keep Alive by default (3000ms)
- Composable
- Timeouts
- HTTPS / HTTP
- Composes well with npm packages for features like cookies, proxies, form data, & OAuth
- Keep 98% of the `simple-get` API (fork source)

When the callback is called, the request is 100% finished, even with streams.


## üöÄ Benchmark Rock-req vs got, axios, node-fetch, phin, simple-get, superagent, ...

Stop using "slow by-default" and "false-light" HTTP request libraries!

> NodeJS 20 activates HTTP keep-alive by default, like `rock-req`

> `undici` is a low-level API, faster alternative to the native NodeJS http module. It is the glass ceiling limit for NodeJS.

> `rock-req` uses only the native NodeJS http module and provides many high-level features, a lot more than `phin` and `simple-get` with fewer lines of code.

> Tested on Macbook Pro M1 Max
